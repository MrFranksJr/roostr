## Overview

**Live version [here](https://roostrtweet.netlify.app/)**

I'm currently refreshing my entire JavaScript knowledge through a course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses)
The assignment focused primarily on different essential JavaScript concepts such as:
* **textareas**: Already knew about these but it's the first time in class we used these
* **.forEach()**: interesting entry on how to use forEach on arrays and objects
* **data-attributes**: an extremely interesting piece on data attributes and how to use them in JavaScript. This was really handy

With these basics, the app basically reads an array of different objects in a JS Module, draws elements on the screen and allows you to pick a 'mood'.
The selected 'mood' returns a matching GIF or meme of Cats.

## Some background

I made this app my own and called it 'Kramiek's Purrrfect Memepicker', after our recently deceased cat Kramiek ðŸ˜¿
